Make (sort of) timelapse videos of your gpx route files!

Needs python. Tested only on Windows.

## How it works

1. Put your .gpx files in the 'input' folder. 
  - Best results if you include files from just one region.
  - If you're using a workout tracking service that doesn't have a mass gpx export feature, there may be browser scripts that do it for you.
  - [GPS track editor](http://www.gpstrackeditor.com/) is a great free program to edit .gpx files in case they need tidying up.
